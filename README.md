Submission for the Finding Donors for CharityML project. The project is a part of the machine learning nanodegree from Udacity.
## Usage:
In order to run the jupyter notebook youll need: Jupyter, Python and a few libraries such as SciKit-Learn these can all be installed by getting a bundle such as [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) which will install all requirements.

## Final findings:
after evaulating multiple diffrent models, i decided that gradient boosting classifier is the most optimal chice for this problem. After running a gridsearch to tune the hyperparameters of the model it achived an accuracy score of **87.04%**

### submission:
